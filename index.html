        <h3>Monolith BBS</h3>

<p>Monolith is a telnet based BBS system which is a completely rewritten version of YAWC (Yet Another Wersion of Citadel, created by Kenneth Haglund), which in turn was based on DOC (Daves Own version of Citadel, created by David Lacey), which was based on Citadel at some time in the murky past.</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>This is a telnet based BBS, not a telephone based BBS. It contains forums, private mail, direct messages, common irc-style chat rooms and friends and enemies lists. A PHP based web interface also allows users to access the system and interact with other users via a browser.</p>

<h3>Where did it come from?</h3>

<p>After a bunch of dutch students found their dutch-language chat room removed from the <a href="http://www.iscabbs.com/">ISCA BBS</a> they obtained YAWC<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAWC">YAWC</a> code and bootstrapped their own BBS, which quickly became oddly popular.</p>

<p>Monolith BBS started life as HAL9000 BBS in 1995 on an internet-connected 486 with 16MB of RAM in a computer lab at the <a href="http://www.utwente.nl/">University of Twente</a> in the then <em>TBK</em> building, which is now known as "Vleugel". The computer ran Slackware Linux and sported a note saying "Running simulations, do not turn off" to prevent students from booting it into MS-DOS and running WordPerfect on it and to stop the cleaners turning it off at night. With mixed results.</p>

<p>After one of the sysops moved to on-campus accommodation in 1996, the BBS was moved to a 486 attached to his dedicated 10Mbit internet connection with a static IP address and renamed to Monolith.</p>
