Welcome to the Monolith BBS Package.

This package is a full featured BBS system, based on YAWC, DaveCode,
Citadel, DOC, etc.

Read INSTALL for information on how to install.
(Basically, run `./configure; make', you don't need to dothis as root)

After that you need to do the following as root:

* add a group `bbs' to /etc/group
* add a user `bbs' to /etc/passwd, the user should have /usr/bbs 
    as homedir, and be in the `bbs' group.

* run `make install' to install the binaries

* add the daemons to /etc/inetd.conf
Here are sample entries from Monolith 
/etc/inetd.conf
bbs     stream  tcp     nowait  bbs     /usr/bbs/bin/front   front
monoclient stream tcp   nowait  bbs     /usr/bbs/bin/server     server
dexi    stream  tcp     nowait  bbs     /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/bbs/bin/dexi
private stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.telnetd

In /etc/services define the services to the ports you want them to use.
/etc/services
bbs             23/tcp
monoclient      1976/tcp
dexi            1996/tcp
private         24/tcp

Here we moved the telnet port to port 24 (normally unused), and put the
bbs on the normal telnet port.

* The `make install' procedure does not yet copy all files in share/ to
  the bbs directories. You have to copy those by hand.

* Create dirs in /usr/bbs/save/quads with numbers from 0 to MAXROOMS 
  (usually 150)

* Chown everything in /usr/bbs/ to the bbs user
 
* The bbs is now running. You can login, and create an account for yourself

* You can make the first account a sysop by running `makeemp username'
  The utility is in the /usr/bbs/bin directory

* Add something to your startupfiles that removes etc/geheugensleutel
  after each reboot
