*** This is your Monolith BBS validation key ***

Welcome new user!

This e-mail contains your validation key to get full access to Monolith
BBS.  When you login to Monolith BBS again, you will be asked to enter
your this key. Enter the number mentioned in the subject of this e-mail
and you will be granted full access.

You can also validate yourself by pressing <c> to get into the config
menu and then press <k> and <e> to enter your validation key. To make
things easier for you, and to get to know the BBS easier, below we
provide a list of basic functions in the BBS.

*** Reading Quadrants and posting in Quadrants

<k> gives you a full list of all Quadrants available on the BBS.
<j> lets you jump to a specific quad by either typing the Quadrant 
    number, or typing the Quadrant name. Most of the time you only have 
    to type a small part of the quadrant name (like the first 4 letters).
<space> lets you read the posts that have been made in the Quadrant 
    you're reading. Pressing <space> continously will scroll you through
    all messages of the BBS.
<b>,<o> or <r> let's you read old posts in reverse order.
<e> lets you enter a message in the quadrant you're reading. Some 
    quadrants have an anonymous option. You will be prompted whether you 
    want to post anonymously or not. Hit <enter> twice to finish your post, 
    and then <s> to save it, or <a> to abort, if you decide you don't want 
    to post the message you just typed.
<d> lets you delete a post. (you can only delete your own posts).
<z> enables you to <z>ap a quadrant. This mean you will not automatically
    read new posts there.

*** Sending and reading eXpress messages

An eXpress message is a message you send to a specific user on the BBS.
That user is the only one who can read it.  Pressing <x> lets you send
an eXpress message to a certain user. You'll be asked whom you want to
send it to. Then you have seven lines to enter a message. You send the
message by pressing <enter/return> twice.

<ctrl-x> lets you view your old eXpress messages.

We can't cover all functions Monolith BBS offers in this e-mail because 
that would make this text too long. If you encounter any problems while 
using the BBS, feel free to hit <shift-Q>.  This will send your question
to an experienced user, who is willing to help you.

The system guides (or Help Terminals, as they are called on Monolith BBS)
are your friend! They will be happy to help you with any problem you 
encounter on Monolith BBS. You can also get additional help by pressing 
<?> for a list of basic commands, and <h> to get more detailed help from 
the Monolith helpfiles. You wil get a list of topics.

So the ways to get help are:
 * Press <shift-q> to ask a question to a guide.
 * Press <?> for context sensitive help.
 * Press <h> for the main documentation of the BBS (the helpfiles)

We hope this e-mail has helped you understand the BBS-functions more 
easily. Enjoy your stay at Monolith BBS! If you've forgotten the adress
