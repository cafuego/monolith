g	As you step into your spaceship, make yourself comfortable and
gput the coordinates of the earth in your automatic-pilot you hear a
gfriendly female voice on the intercom.w "yPlease fasten your seatbeltsw"
g	You look out the window and see Monolith Spacestation calmly
gfloating away from you. You wipe a tear from your eye, but you know
gyou'll be back real soon. Just before the acceleration hits you you
ghear the voice of the House Spirit once more....
