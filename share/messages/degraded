cSorry, but this command is not allowed for rdegradedc users. Users are
usually degraded because they haven't filled in full or correct address
info. You can fix this by pressing y<gcy>config y<gay>cddress. If you have done
this please y<gyy>cell to become a normal user again. 
If you have filled your real address, and you don't know why you are 
degraded, y<gyy>cell to the wAdminsc, to ask them to explain things
to you.
