gTired of typing in the same names to send ew<rxw>gpress messages?  Do your fingers
have blisters on them?  There's an easier way..  First, you have to set up a
quick x-friends list.  To do so, press w<r<w>g, w<rAw>g and he system will ask you
which slot you want to edit.  (a number from 0 to 9)  Pick a slot, enter the
Alien's name, and voila.  Now, you can just press the number to send that user
an ew<rxw>gpress message, instead of typing it all out.  (Cool, huh?)  
 
Also, the number of the Alien will appear in his/her flags column in the
w<rww>gholist, in case you forget which Alien is in what slot.
