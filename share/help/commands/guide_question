g 
If you have a question about Monolith, you can ask a cHelpTerminalg by pressing
w<rQw>g  (that's w<rShiftw-rQw>g).  cHelpTerminalsg are aliens who know Monolith..  and
volunteer their time to help answer questions about Monolith, and how Monolith
works.  Sometimes, there are no HelpTerminals online, and if this happens to
you, and you need to ask a question, you can always send a w<ryw>gell to the Admin,
or try and find the answer here somewhere in the w<rhw>gelpfiles.
