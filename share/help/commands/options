acfb       *** y Configure Options b ***
 
gThis menu sets most of the configurable options for your Monolith BBS account.
 
1>  rANSI Colours.g  If you have a terminal program that is capable of ANSI      
     colours, enable this option, and you'll see in *ycpoclrowubrg*  If you enable    
     this option and see things like w^[[31;0m gthen sorry, your termtype cannot 
     handle colour.  :(
 
2>  rExpert Alien.g  This option turns off most of the help prompts..  If you    
     think you know your way around Monolith, try this.  
 
3>  rSee last old message.g  Shows the last old message in a quadrant when       
     reading posts.
 
4>  rPrompt after each message.g  You should probably keep this enabled, unless
     you want to read an entire quadrant without pressing the spacebar. 
     Disabling this option causes all the messages in the quadrant to scroll by
     without stopping between Posts.
 
5>  rPause after each screenfull.g  You should probably keep this option enabled.
     If a post is more than a screen long, enabling this option will pause the
     post from scrolling at every screenfull.
 
6>  rToggle Hidden Info.g  Brings up a menu that allows you to hide some or all
     of your personal information.  Hiding your information means that when 
     another alien profiles you, they won't see it.  If you have rANSI Coloursg,
     when you profile yourself, the information that you've hidden from the
     rest of the aliens will appear in "agdimf" text.

acfg7>   rTerminal Screen Length.g   Allows you to set the number of lines your      
      screen will display.  Most terminal windows are w[r24w]g lines long, and it's
      no accident that the default for this option is w[r24w]g.  
 
8>   rFlashing Colours Enabled.g  Enable this if you want to be able to see
      "ferFlashingafg" colours. (colors that blink on and off)
 
9>   rBold Colours Enabled. g Enable this if you want to be able to see "bold"   
      colors.
 
A>   rDisabled X's at login.  gEnable this if you want your express messages     
      turned off by default when you login.  (And note that you'll have to turn
      them on with w<rShiftw-rXw>g if you want to send/receive ew<rxw>gpress messages.)
 
B>   rRecieve logon/logoff notifies.g  Enable this option, and the system will
      notify you when Aliens on your friendslist log on, or off.  For more 
      information on your friendslist, see the helpfiles on  
      fyCommandsac fg-> yExpress Commands g-> yFriendslistg.
 
C>   rUse the SHIX System. g The SHIX system prevents other users from sending
      you messages that contain profanity, or sexual content.  Note that this
      is an experimental system.  For more information, see the helpfile on 
      the ySHIXg system.
 
D>   rHide your hostname.g  Does just that..  prevents other Aliens from seeing
      where you are logged in from in thew <rww>gholist, and w<rpw>grofile. 

acfgE>   rShow Status Bar.g  Enabling this option turns on the fbWStatus BargD, which is a
      line at the bottom of your screen that shows the time, and various other 
      things.  This option has been known to cause trouble with some terminal  
      programs, so if you enable it and your screen goes awry, your terminal   
      program and this option probably don't like each other..  disable it to  
      get a nice clean screen back.
 
F>   rInterBBS Access.g  The InterBBS is an ongoing project with other YAWC BBS's
      that allows access to those BBS's from Monolith, and vice versa.
      Enabling this option will allow you to send and receive ew<rxw>gpress        
      messages from users on these other BBS's.  For more information, read the
      helpfiles on yInterBBSg.
 
G>   rDisable Command List.g  Using this option turns off the list of available  
      commands at every prompt.  You can still get the list of available       
      commands by pressing w<r?w>g, or the full list by pressing w<r/w>g.
 
H>   rShow IP Address in the wholist.g  Enabling this option will show your IP   
      (also known as numeric) internet address next to your name in the        
      "Planet" column in the w<rww>gholist.
 
I>   rShow Friends Online Upon Login.g  Enable this option if you want the system
      to check your friendslist when you login.  The system will then tell you
      which of the aliens in your friendslist (if any) are online.

acfgJ>   rUse Standard Alias.  gIf you have defined a standard "alias" using w<rcw> <raw>g,ad
fg      you can enable this option to automatically set your alias for b          
      *anonymous*g posting, and anonymous programmes in the Holodeck.ad
 
fgK>   frReceive all logon events.  gEnabling this option means you will be notified
      by the system anytime *any* Alien logs on or off.
 
L>   rReceive friends logon notifies.g  Enabling this option means that the      
      system will check your friendslist, and notify you when aliens on your   
      friendslist log on, or off.
