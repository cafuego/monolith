acfy       ***  bChange Password y ***
g 
Your password on Monolith keeps rbadg aliens out of your account.  You should
change it every so often to keep the rbadg aliens guessing.  
 
How it works:  the system will ask you for your old password.  Type that in,
and then enter your new password.  The system will ask you to re-enter the
new password, to be sure that there were no typ3oes.  (:
 
It's that simple, and the next time you login, your new password will work.
