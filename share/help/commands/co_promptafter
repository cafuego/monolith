fb       *** y Toggle Prompt after Post b ***g
 
Toggles whether the system prompts you for a command after you read a post.

Disabling this option causes all the messages in the quadrant to scroll by
without stopping between Posts.  Useful if you want to dump an entire quad
to your screen..  Otherwise, leave this on.
