fb
fgAdds a user to your enemylist.

Users who are on your enemies list cannot:
   Send you eXpress messages.
   Send you mail.

You cannot send those users eXpress messages to users on your enemy list.

You can also add Remote users to your enemy list with this syntax:

    username@BBS

For example, adding 'Bing@Bong' would prevent the user Bing on Bong BBS
from sending you any InterBBS eXpress messages.
