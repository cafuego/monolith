ac    fb   ***  yReply to a Postb  ***
g 
Sometimes you're reading, and you want to respond to a particular post.  To do
this, press w<rrw>geply while at the post you want to reply to.  If the quadrant
the post is in has the fySubjectlineac fgoption, w<rrw>geply automatically sets the
ysubjectlineg in your reply to show the post number, author, and subjectline of
the post you're replying to.  
 
Note:  In quadrants without the ysubjectlineg option, it acts just like pressing
w       <rew>gnter.
