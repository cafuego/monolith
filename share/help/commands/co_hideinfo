fb       *** y Hide Personal Information b ***g

A menu that allows you to hide some or all of your personal information.

     Hiding your information means that when another user profiles you, 
     they won't see it.  If you have rANSI Coloursg enabled,
     when you profile yourself, the information that you've hidden from the
     rest of the users will appear in "agdimf" text.
     Hiding your information completely hides it from other users, excepting
     the Administration.  (sysops)
