fb       *** y Toggle StatusBar b ***g

Turns the status bar on and off.

  The Status Bar is a line at the bottom or top of your screen that shows
  who is sending you an eXpress message, the time, and various other 
  things.  This option has been known to cause trouble with some terminal  
  programs, so if you enable it and your screen goes awry, your terminal   
  program and this option probably don't like each other..  disable it to  
  get a nice clean screen back.
