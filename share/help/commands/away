ac fb      *** y Away status b***

gSometimes, even the most ardent of users have to step away from the computer
for a few minutes..  say, to make a pot of coffee for instance.  Hitting
w<rshift-Aw>g marks you as rawayg in the w<rww>gholist, and tells other users you're
away from the keyboard (afk) if they send you an ew<rxw>gpress message.  We have
this option so that the users you were talking with, arguing with, smooching,
or flaming won't think you're a rude user because you don't respond (since
you're away)..
