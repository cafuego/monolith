ac fb      ***  rValidation Key Helpscreen b ***
 
gIf you're not validated yet, and you've made it this far, read this screen
carefully..  it's a fairly painless process to become validated.
 
A rValidation Keyg is a code that Monolith will send you after your address
information is checked.  rYour e-mail address must be correct, or the key will
never reach you!g  If your e-mail address isn't correct, you have to w<ryw>gell to
wAdming to get it changed..  we change a lot of e-mail addresses for people, and
it's not a problem.  (:
 
  To w<ryw>gell to the Admin to get one of us to change your e-mail:
     Command Sequence:  w<ryw>gell, w<rYw>gell, w<rYw>gell.  w(gpress ryw, rYw,r Yw)g  
        Then type in what you need an e-mail change, and give us the correct
        e-mail address.  We'll change it as soon as we see the Yell.
 
If your e-mail address is correct, and you havn't received a key, you can send
yourself another one using the Key menu.

bCommand Sequencew:  <rsw>gtop  w<rShift-Cw>gonfig  w<rkw>gey    w(gpress rsw,r cw,r kw)g
