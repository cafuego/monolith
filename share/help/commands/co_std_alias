fb       *** y Standard Alias b ***g

Toggles whether or not the system uses your "standard alias" for 
b*anonymous*g posts.  Note that you have to set a standard alias in the 
w<rCw>gonfig menu for this option to have any effect.

Useful if you post a lot of anonymous posts with the same alias.
