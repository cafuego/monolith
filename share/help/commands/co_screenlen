fb       *** y Set Screenlength b ***g

Allows you to set the number of lines of text on a single screen.

If a post or other information is longer than one screenful, the 
screenlength is how many lines appear at a time before a --more-- prompt.

Note: Most terminal windows are w[r24w]g lines long, and it's
      no accident that the default for this option is w[r24w]g.
