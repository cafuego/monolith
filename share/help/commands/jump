acfb       *** y Jump to a Quadrantb  ***
 
gJump to another quadrant by name or number.

To w<rjw>gump:
 - Press w<rjw>g.
 - Type in the ynameg or the wnumberg of the quadrant you want
   to "land" in.

Note that using this command will mark any messages left in the room you're 
currently in as "read".  There is another jump command, w<rShiftw-rJw>g that does
the same thing as w<rjw>g but doesn't mark the current room as "read."
