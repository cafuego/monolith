ac fb      ***  yRead next post b ***
g 
Displays the next unread post. 

The w<rspacebarw>g also executes this command, as it is probably the
      most commonly used command.

If there are no new posts in the current room, w<rnw>gext checks the rest of the
rooms that you read, and if there are unread posts in another room you read,
w<rnw>gext will move you into that room automatically.
