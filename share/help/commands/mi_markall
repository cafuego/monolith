Moves your last-seen message pointer to the last message in all quadrants.

This has the effect of making the BBS think you've read all the messages
in all your quadrants.

Sometimes, if a BBS session is terminated abnormally, your lastseen 
message pointers aren't updated.  If you've just finished reading all
the new messages, and get [disconnected], when you log back in, you'll
see all those messages again, because the BBS never updated your userfile.
In this case, this function is highly useful.
