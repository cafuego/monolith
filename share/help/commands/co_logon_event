fb       *** y Toggle Bold Colors b ***g

Toggles display of bold colors.  

 
A>   rDisabled X's at login.  gEnable this if you want your express messages     
      turned off by default when you login.  (And note that you'll have to turn
      them on with w<rShiftw-rXw>g if you want to send/receive ew<rxw>gpress messages.)
 
B>   rRecieve logon/logoff notifies.g  Enable this option, and the system will
      notify you when Aliens on your friendslist log on, or off.  For more 
      information on your friendslist, see the helpfiles on  
      fyCommandsac fg-> yExpress Commands g-> yFriendslistg.
 
C>   rUse the SHIX System. g The SHIX system prevents other users from sending
      you messages that contain profanity, or sexual content.  Note that this
      is an experimental system.  For more information, see the helpfile on 
      the ySHIXg system.
 
D>   rHide your hostname.g  Does just that..  prevents other Aliens from seeing
      where you are logged in from in thew <rww>gholist, and w<rpw>grofile. 

acfgE>   rShow Status Bar.g  Enabling this option turns on the fbWStatus BargD, which is a
      line at the bottom of your screen that shows the time, and various other 
      things.  This option has been known to cause trouble with some terminal  
      programs, so if you enable it and your screen goes awry, your terminal   
      program and this option probably don't like each other..  disable it to  
      get a nice clean screen back.
 
F>   rInterBBS Access.g  The InterBBS is an ongoing project with other YAWC BBS's
      that allows access to those BBS's from Monolith, and vice versa.
      Enabling this option will allow you to send and receive ew<rxw>gpress        
      messages from users on these other BBS's.  For more information, read the
      helpfiles on yInterBBSg.
 
G>   rDisable Command List.g  Using this option turns off the list of available  
      commands at every prompt.  You can still get the list of available       
      commands by pressing w<r?w>g, or the full list by pressing w<r/w>g.
 
H>   rShow IP Address in the wholist.g  Enabling this option will show your IP   
      (also known as numeric) internet address next to your name in the        
      "Planet" column in the w<rww>gholist.
 
I>   rShow Friends Online Upon Login.g  Enable this option if you want the system
      to check your friendslist when you login.  The system will then tell you
      which of the aliens in your friendslist (if any) are online.

acfgJ>   rUse Standard Alias.  gIf you have defined a standard "alias" using w<rcw> <raw>g,ad
fg      you can enable this option to automatically set your alias for b          
      *anonymous*g posting, and anonymous programmes in the Holodeck.ad
 
fgK>   frReceive all logon events.  gEnabling this option means you will be notified
      by the system anytime *any* Alien logs on or off.
 
L>   rReceive friends logon notifies.g  Enabling this option means that the      
      system will check your friendslist, and notify you when aliens on your   
      friendslist log on, or off.
