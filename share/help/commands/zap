gIf you decide you no longer wish to read a quadrant, you can remove it from
your w<rkw>gnownlist, and the system won't take you there automatically when there
are new messages.
 
To w<rzw>gap the current Quadrant: 
  press w<rzw>g, and answer "yes" at the zap prompt.

To unzap a quadrant:
  w<rjw>gump to the quadrant.  If you can't remember it's name, look
  through the w<rKw>gnownlist.
