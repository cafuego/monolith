fb       *** y Set Timezone b ***g

This menu system allows dates and times to be converted to your own
timezone.

To use, select a continent from the first menu.  Then select a city
that is in your timezone from the second menu.  

Note:  if your timezone is set, users will be able to tell what time
it is in your timezone in your profile, useful to know when you're 
(maybe) keeping that user up past his/her bedtime.  (;
