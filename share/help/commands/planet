g 
Your planet is a column in the w<rww>gholist, that shows where you're
posting from.  If you'd rather be from somewhere else for this login session,
this is the option for you!  
 
yNotesw:g  
     b-g The planet can be up to 17 characters long.  
 
     b-g If you change it, the change only lasts as long as you're online. (this 
       session) It'll be reset to your "country" when you login again.
 
     b-g If you have your "country" information hidden, nothing will show up in
       your planet column in the w<rww>gholist.
