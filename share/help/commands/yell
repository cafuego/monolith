Key Sequencew: <ryw> <rYw> <rYw>g
 
A Yell is a message that you send to the wAdming of Monolith, and only wFleetg
wCommandersg and wEmporersg can see yells.  There are a variety of reasons you
might want to send a w<ryw>gell for, some of these are:
 
-  You need to ask a question, and no cHelpTerminalsg are online.
 
-  You need your address information or e-mail address changed.

-  You want to tell us what a great place this is.  
 
-  You want to bring a problem (harassment, cQuadrant Leaderg complaint, etc.) to
   the attention of the wAdmin.g
 
rPleaseg don't abuse the w<ryw>gell command, as most of the things that are w<ryw>gelled
about are serious, and sending non-serious w<ryw>gells scrolls the serious yells.
