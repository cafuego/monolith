      |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
      + Monolith BBS is of the YAWC BBS variety, but extensively modified +
      + by the Monolith programmers. YAWC was originally written by       +
      + KHaglund, and resembles DOC. Monolith is located in Enschede, The +
      + Netherlands, and was started in the summer of 1995.               +

Using the commands on Monolith BBS:   

  +You'll almost never have to press <return> or <enter>, as all 
   commands are activated by pressing just the key.
  +Help on commands usually lists the command in angle braces like
   this:  <command>   For example, if it says '<e>nter message'
   it means that you should press the  e  key:  just the  e, and not
   the angle braces.
  +Commands are case sensitive.  This means a lower case letter isn't the   
   same as an UPPER CASE LETTER.  (i.e. <S>  is not the same as <s>.)

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

The rules on Monolith BBS:

  There are some rules you'll have to follow on Monolith, but the rules are 
  not unusual.  By exercising common politeness you should do just fine.
  We're known as a very free, very open BBS, and we are trying to adhere to
  that reputation. The exact rules are documented in the helpfiles and in
  the <i>nfo in the Docking Bay, both of which you will see later.

Ok..  Enough about us, let's talk about you.  
 
First, you need to choose a username.  This does not have to be your real
name..  Your username is what you would like to be called on Monolith.
  
        Please do not choose offensive names. If you do, you will
        be asked to change it once you have made the account, and you
