Now you need to choose a password for your account.  It is a good idea to
choose a password that another person, even one who knows you very well,
would be unable to guess. Try something with punctuation, or a nonsense
word such as `bing'.

It is in your best interest to choose a password that no one else will guess,
because you are held responsible for the conduct of your account and your
privilege to use this BBS will be suspended if your account is used to take
actions that violate BBS rules.  Also, please make sure to choose a password
you will remember, as getting your password reset is not an easy process.
