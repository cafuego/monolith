This is something i quickly copy&pasted from other licenses.
It isn't etched in stone, you can always email me to see if we can
work things out. The licence is still quite restrictive, because what
i don't want now is the diverging of software versions like what happened
with YAWC. You can always ask me for a new (updated) version, and in the
near future I'll add a bit permitting you to redistribute the (unmodified)
code.
